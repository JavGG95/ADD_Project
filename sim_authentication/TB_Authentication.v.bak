// clk: 50MHz internal FPGA clock.
// rst: reset push-button on FPGA board
// pwdigit: 4-bit integer user inputs via toggle switches as ID or PW.
// pwenter: push-button when user is finished typing in ID or PW.
// log_out_ctrl: input from GameController telling when to log out.

// WIRE
// log_in_ctrl: output sent to GameController showing when User is logged in.
// isGuest_ctrl: passthrough output sent to GameController showing if it is a guest ID/PW
// intID_ctrl: passthrough output sent to GameController showing which User is playing.
